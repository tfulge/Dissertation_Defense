## Dissertation Defense

This repository includes the presentation for my dissertation defense to be held on May 13rd, 2022 at the University of Bremen.

Future Ph.D. candidates may be interested in the LaTeX-template I developed which is more RMarkdown friendly than the official version provided by the BIGSSS. It is called *beamerthemeBIGSSS.sty* and can be incorporated by specifiying `theme: BIGSSS` in the YAML of the Rmarkdown presentation.
