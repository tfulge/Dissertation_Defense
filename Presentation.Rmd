## Einstieg 

Ist es mÃ¶glich, einen Umlaut zu zeigen?

This article was written by @Ansell.2008b.

The same author has supporting evidence [@Ansell.2013].

Another argument was advanced by Garritzmann [-@garritzmann2016]

Does Markdown automatically expand on the references section [@Pierson.1993; @Hall.1996; @Hall.2001]?

## Slide with (incremental) Bullets

> - Eat eggs
> - Drink coffee
>    - Have at it

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, fig.cap = "Illustration of higher education system ideal types",echo = F,warning = F, message = F, out.height= "4cm"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Intro/Enrolment_over_time-1.pdf")
```

- What happens if I put stuff here?

- Doesn't seem to automatically resize the plot

## Next slide with plot

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```
- Is he willing to do what I want here?

- By which I mean automatically resizing the image at hand

- He doesnt, not even now?
