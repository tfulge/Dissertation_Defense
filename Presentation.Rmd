## R Markdown

Ist es m√∂glich, einen Umlaut zu zeigen?

This article was written by @Ansell.2008b.

The same author has supporting evidence [@Ansell.2013].

Another argument was advanced by Garritzmann [-@garritzmann2016]

Does Markdown automatically expand on the references section [@Pierson.1993; @Hall.1996; @Hall.2001]?
